# Who I am?
My name is Caylee Shea Harrington. I'm a professional full-stack engineer who develops web applications (including backend and frontend tasks), API endpoints, custom protocol implementations and handles a lot of other various tasks. Do as I say, not as I do right? As Director of Women Who Code for Phoenix, AZ I always encourage the members to keep their GitHub/Lab active- as of late, I have spent my recent time invested entirely in pushing code for my employer and am working on putting current work on this profile.

## About me
I love to create, and my favorite way to do this is through web development. Fulfilling business needs with high-quality, fast, user-friendly apps is my passion. I excel at solving technical problems using Python and/or JavaScript, and I also build expert applications from scratch in these languages or the frameworks that sit atop these.

One of my team leads described me by saying, â€œCaylee is entirely reliable in completing a story thoroughly and ensuring it is well tested. She communicates with team members very effectively. Her efforts on the frontend update were invaluable- she not only went well above expectations but helped to manage the process even when pulled on other tasks."
I never give up and I always push myself to create innovative solutions that solve real-world problems.

## What Ive executed?

- Simple websites, mobile apps and custom Web Applications
- RESTfull, custom API endpoints in Python
- Software performance optimization
- Asynchronous integration in API using Django Consumers to improve user experience on requests performed on bulk endpoints
- Git (including GitHub and GitLab)
- Existing code evaluation, Debugging and improvement
My specialties are Python (Django, DRF), JavaScript (NodeJS, React.JS, React Native, Vue JS, jQuery and other) and Performance optimization. However, I also have significant experience with additional tools and toolkits. Feel free to ask me more about the languages or instruments that will be required for your project.


## Portfolio
So my most recent work (past year) Ive worked with a company with a custom in-house application so I can't show everything here. I will be pushing recent code very shortly.
